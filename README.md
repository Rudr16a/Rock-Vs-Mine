# Rock-Vs-Mine
# Rock vs Mine Detection

Welcome to the Rock vs Mine Detection project! This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines (metal cylinders). The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between these two types of objects.

## Introduction

Classifying sonar signals is a crucial task in many applications, including underwater exploration and defense. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze sonar signals and classify them as either rocks or mines, helping in the identification and differentiation of these objects.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, feature extraction, and splitting data into training and test sets.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementations of various models including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Classify new sonar signals as either rocks or mines.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account
- Basic knowledge of machine learning

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-vs-mine-detection.git
   cd rock-vs-mine-detection
   ```

2. Open the project in Google Colab:

   - Upload the `rock_vs_mine_detection.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab.

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load the dataset and preprocess the sonar signal data (normalization, feature extraction).

2. **Train the Model**: Train the model using the preprocessed data.

3. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to classify new sonar signals.

Detailed instructions for each step are provided in the `rock_vs_mine_detection.ipynb` notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+%28sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks%29) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 208 instances of sonar signals, with each instance having 60 features representing the energy of the return signals at various angles.

## Model Architecture

The project implements several machine learning models for classification:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**

Each model is evaluated to determine the best performing one for this classification task.

## Results

The models achieve high accuracy in classifying sonar signals as rocks or mines. Detailed results, including training and validation accuracy/loss plots and evaluation metrics, are provided in the notebook.
